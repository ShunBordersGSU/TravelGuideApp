# TravelGuideApp

This is a basic app that shows a select number of countries from five continents in a recylcer view. When a country is selected,
addition information about this country is shown in a card view. Along with addition information, the ability to rate the 
country along with the ability to add comments about this country are availble in card view. Also, the user can opt to remove
other countries, belonging to the current country's continent, from the country list recylcer view by selecting "NO"
to the question "Would you like to visit countries in the same continent". More countries from the current country's continent
can be added to the country list recylcer view by select "YES" to this question.
